#Project explanation:

The project is based on the game Flappy Bird. Information from Wikipedia: Flappy Bird is a 2013 mobile game, developed by Vietnam-based developer Nguyễn Hà Đông. Gameplay:Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling mobile game featuring 2D retro style graphics. The objective is to direct a flying bird, named "Faby", which moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. If the player touches the pipes, it ends the game. The bird briefly flaps upward each time the player taps the screen; if the screen is not tapped, the bird falls due to gravity. The player is scored based on the number of pipes that the bird successfully passes through, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game.
There is no variation or evolution in gameplay throughout the game as the pipes always have the same gap between them and there is no end to the running track, having only the flap and ding sounds and the rising score as rewards.
